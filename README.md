Handwritten Digit Recognition
This project demonstrates the implementation of a handwritten digit recognition system using TensorFlow and Keras for training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter for digit input and prediction.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to create a system that can recognize digits drawn by users. It involves two main components:

Model Training: A CNN model is trained on the MNIST dataset, which contains images of handwritten digits. The model is trained to classify these digits and save the trained model to a file.

Digit Recognition GUI: A Tkinter-based GUI allows users to draw digits on a canvas. The drawn digit is captured, processed, and then predicted by the trained model. The result is displayed along with the confidence score.

Project Components
1. Model Training
Libraries Used: TensorFlow, Keras
Dataset: MNIST
Model Architecture:
Conv2D layers for feature extraction
MaxPooling2D layers for down-sampling
Dense layers for classification
Dropout layers to prevent overfitting
Training: The model is trained with a batch size of 64 and for 10 epochs. Model checkpoints are used to save the best-performing model.
2. GUI for Digit Recognition
Libraries Used: Tkinter, PIL, NumPy, win32gui
Functionality:
Users can draw digits on a canvas.
The drawn image is captured, resized, and processed.
The processed image is fed into the trained model for prediction.
The predicted digit and confidence score are displayed on the GUI.
Installation
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/handwritten-digit-recognition.git
cd handwritten-digit-recognition
Install Dependencies:
Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. Then, install the required libraries using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install tensorflow keras numpy pillow pywin32
Model Training:
Run the train_model.py script to train the model:

bash
Copy code
python train_model.py
Run the GUI Application:
After training, run the GUI application:

bash
Copy code
python gui_application.py
Usage
Training: Execute the training script to train and save the model. The model will be saved as model.h5 in the project directory.

Using the GUI: Open the GUI application, draw a digit on the canvas, and click the "Classify" button to see the predicted digit and confidence score.

Notes
Ensure you have the mnist.h5 model file available in the project directory for the GUI application to load.
Adjust paths and configurations as needed based on your system setup.
